	Bad credentials rejected: Works
	create_user page: Works
	User creation: Works
	Reject duplicate users: Works
	Login and reach dashboard: Works

2. Test Dashboard links
	Username and role: Works
	All internal pages linked from dashboard: Works
	Needs Times Set: Works (empty initially)

3. Test Add Facility
	Add DC facility: Works
	Reject duplicate DC facility: Works (as a note, Assignment 7 specs say that there should be no duplicate common names OR fcodes, so a new DC facility with a different fcode might need to be rejected too.)
	Add HQ facility: Works

4. Test Add Asset
	Facility options limited to existing facilities: Works.
	Add asset to DC: Works
	Duplicate asset rejected: Works
	Add asset to HQ: Works

5. Dispose Asset
	Dispose of asset 12: *Works - Asset is successfully disposed, but there is no notification of disposal. User is just silently routed to dashboard.
	Dispose of asset 12 again, rejected: Works
	

6. Asset Report /asset_report
	Report for DC 3/1/2017 shows asset 12: Works
	Report for no facility on 3/2/2017 shows asset 23: Works

7. Request asset_transfer /transfer_req
	Request transfer for asset 12: Works (although should it? asset 12 has been marked disposed.)
	Second request for asset 12, notified of duplicate: **Does not work, second request goes though with same success page.
	Request transfer for asset 23: Works

8. Go to create_user and create a user with facilities officer privilege
	Login with Facilities Officer, no dispose asset/transfer request options: Works
	Items appear for approval: *Works - 3 items appear, not two. This is consistent with behavior from previous step, though.
	Deny first request, request no longer on dashboard: Works
	Approve second request, request no longer on dashboard: Works

9. Go to login screen and login with logistics officer credentials
	Set load and unload times: Works 
	Transfer request cleared from dashboard: Works
